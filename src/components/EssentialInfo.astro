                <p>Common plumbing issues can disrupt any household, often leading to frustration and costly repairs. Leaky faucets are among the most frequent problems, wasting water and increasing utility bills. Clogged drains, caused by hair, grease, and debris, can result in slow drainage or complete blockages. Toilets that constantly run or fail to flush properly can indicate deeper issues, such as a faulty flapper or clogged vent. Additionally, water heater problems, like inconsistent temperatures or leaks, can leave homeowners without hot water when they need it most. Regular maintenance and prompt attention to these issues can help prevent larger problems down the line and ensure a smoothly running plumbing system. <a href="#" class="text-blue-500">Read More</a></p>
